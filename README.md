# 📅 tabletimes — Your Timetable, One Tap Away

“Hey, what class do we have right now?”  
“Uhh... I think it’s Math... or maybe English?”  
Classic.

When your friends don’t know, you’re left digging through your gallery — desperately scrolling past 200 memes and blurry screenshots 🖼️🤣, trying to find your timetable.

And for what? Just to figure out *what class you’re in right now*?

That’s exactly why we built **tabletimes** — a ridiculously simple way to check your schedule on the spot.

No app ❌. No login 🔒. No confusion 🌀.

Just scan a QR code 📲 on your classroom wall and boom — you instantly see the current subject.

## ⚡ What Is *tabletimes*?

**tabletimes** is your no-nonsense, ultra-fast timetable assistant.

- 🚶🏻‍♂️ Walk into class.
- 🤳🏻 Scan a QR code.
- 🎯 Instantly see what class is happening *right now*.

That’s it.

No digging through screenshots.  
No asking your group chat.  
No making your timetable your lockscreen (again).

And once you [add it to your home screen](https://tabletimes.vercel.app/info#quick-access)? It’s always one tap away.

## 💡 The “Wait, What If…?” Moment

One night, we saw a reel.  
One thought: *“What if checking the timetable was as easy as scanning a QR code?”*  
One DM. Two coffees. A bunch of late nights later — tabletimes was born.

Built by students. For students.

## 🔧 Under the Hood (If You're Curious)

We kept it lean and focused:

- Zero clutter — just what you need
- Loads instantly (no spinners or splash screens)
- Works beautifully on mobile
- Built with students in mind, not analytics dashboards

We also built a [free attendance calculator](https://tabletimes.vercel.app/calculator) because — let’s be honest — we’ve all played the "How many classes can I skip?" game.😂

## 🎁 Pro Tip

After your first visit, tap **“Add to Home Screen.”**  
It turns your timetable into a one-tap experience.  
No searching. No scanning. Just schedule-on-demand.

## 🌱 Why It Matters

Because your time matters.  
Because stress adds up.  
Because student life is chaotic enough.

tabletimes isn’t trying to be the next big app.  
It’s just a tiny tool to make your day a little smoother.
